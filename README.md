We developed new codes to incorporate brown carbon aerosol absorption into the WRF-Chem model. These codes can be used to improve the calcualtion of aerosol-radiation interactions for weather and climate predictions. 

When using the codes in your own modeling, please cite the following study:

Gao, Liu, et al., Significant radiative absorption of brown carbon aerosols from residential fuel combustion in developing regions, Under reivew in Geophysical Research Letters.
